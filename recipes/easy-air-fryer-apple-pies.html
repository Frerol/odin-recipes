<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Use your air fryer to make these bite-size fried apple pies. "This was a very simple and sweet treat. I added more cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple filling for taste. I will be making these again, but will cut and use real apples instead of the can filling for a better taste," says home cook Sammi.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts (2 pie crusts)</li>
    <li>1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place 1 pie crust onto a lightly floured surface and roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Using a 2-1/4-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter cut the pie crust into 10 circles. Repeat with the second pie crust for a total of 20 pie crust circles.</li>
    <li>Fill about 1/2 of each circle with apple pie filling. Place a second pie crust circle on top, making a mini pie. Do not overfill. Press down the edges of the mini pies, crimping with a fork to seal. Brush tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.</li>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place a batch of the mini pies in the air fryer basket, leaving space around each for air circulation.</li>
    <li>Bake until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the basket and bake remaining pies. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
</ol>
